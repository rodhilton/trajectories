Trajectories
============

Project for Artificial Intelligence.

This program takes as input a chess board with or without obstacles, an element p (a chess piece), and start and destination points on the chess board.  It will generate a shortest path (or all shortest paths) from the start to the destination using methods covered in Professor Boris Stilman's Artificial Intelligence class at University of Colorado Denver as well as in his book, "Linguistic Geometry: From Search to Construction"

Requirements
----
This program requires a JVM to run, with either java in the path or a JAVA_HOME variable set.
